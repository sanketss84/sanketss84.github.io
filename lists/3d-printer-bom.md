3D printers are awesome devices and what fascinates me is its construction so I decided to understand how it works and what all goes into a 3D printer and for this I took help from Voron Design documentation to document a list of various spares that go into building a 3D printer.

- the hardware
    - aluminium extrusions
    - pulleys
    - linear rails
    - belts
    - synchromesh an alternative to belts
    - rods for z-axis
    - aluminium bed
    - 3d printed parts for the frame
    - hotend
    - nozzle
- electronics
    - controller board
    - compatible raspberry pi
    - power supply
    - toolboard 
    - stepper drivers to drive the motors
    - stepper motors for X Y Z axis
    - stepper motors to drive the X Y Z axis and extruder
    - thermistor
    - bed heat coil (need to understand whats it called)
