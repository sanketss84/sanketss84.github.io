While I was looking for Kailh MX HotSwap Socket , I observed that a lot of the stores had this out of stock and few of the stores had a Gateron version of the MX socket so was curious if the Gateron would be a drop in replacement for the Kailh.

Seems like the Gateron can be used as an alternative for the Kailh if its not available. I would like to summarize the article shared in references and draw out its key pointers

- Gaterons part number is CPG151101S11 which is the same as Kailh's sockets.
- Initial inspection shows that the measurements sure looks identical and should fit on any PCB design for the later.
- Placing the sockets on PCB, shows that Kailh seems to be more thin.
- There's a small hole on Gateron's fin(?) making bigger solder contact. Clips for switch pins also seems bigger compared to Kailh's. These seems to be a nice improvement.
