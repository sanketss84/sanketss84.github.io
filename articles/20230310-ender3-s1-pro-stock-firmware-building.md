The Ender 3 S1 PRO is based on Marlin and its source code is available on github , note you need to change to the `s1_pro` branch to its code.

I decided to fork this firmware and build my own locally so that I can add fixes and features if need be and I also wanted to understand the build process. This was my first time building any 3d printer firmware on my own. The `s1_pro` 

## tools needed to build marlin locally 
Marlin is the firmware which Creality used on the S1 PRO

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code 
- PlatformIO IDE extension for VS Code

once you have this you are all set to build marlin locally.

## fork the official github repo
Created a fork of the creality branch and add a few of my own branches for working with the firmware. 

- `s1_pro` 
    - should there be any future changes done to official branch will pull it here.
- `s1_pro_fixes` created from `s1_pro`
    - to add fixes by other users and commit them to my forked branch.
    - added fixes by pethical and kamoteshake which fixes the build issues
    - [Pull requests Â· CrealityOfficial/Ender-3S1](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/Ender-3S1/pulls)
- `s1_pro_sanket`  created from `s1_pro`
    - to add fixes by other users and commit them to my forked branch.
    - add my own tweaks and features

so after adding in all the fixes and commiting them I am able to build stock firmware successfully.
