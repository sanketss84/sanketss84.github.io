While choosing a fdm printer (or a printer where you load a filament like PLA, PETG, ABS etc. ) to make prints the first printer you spot online is an Ender 3 by Creality. Ender 3 is synonymous with 3D printing and has a massive community around it and thats why its the first printer for many new to 3D printing. While venturing into a new hobby knowing that there is a huge community to back it, gives you a lot of comfort as support can be faster over reddit or discord chats. Answers to most common problems are a search or community talk away.

## which ender 3 
Ender 3 has a lot of variations and to pick one that suits your needs was a task in itself. Especially if you are buying your first 3D printer then jumping blind and buying any variation of Ender 3 and later knowing that certain features or convenience options are available in another higher priced ender 3 it was better to spend some time understanding the differences between these now. 

The versions 
- Ender3
- Ender3 PRO
- Ender3 V2
- Ender3 V2 NEO
- Ender3 S1
- Ender3 S1 PRO

There are also max and plus versions which I have totally skipped as I wanted to stick with standard size of 220x220x250mm (this is the build volume)

NOTE: here the S1 PRO has build area of 220x220x270mm 

## why I went with S1 PRO
If I were to share a very quick list here it goes

- easy to assemble compared to earlier ender 3 printers
- direct drive sprite extruder its capable of printing upto 300 degree centigrade , which allows you to print variety of print materials
- creality CR touch for automatic bed leveling is quite good for bed imperfections compensation while printing
- magnetic PEI plate for print bed , the prints stick well during printing and pop off easily after printing 
- crisp clear touch screen lcd 
- 32 bit controller board and marlin 2 support
- silent steppers operation
- full size sd card in the front
- usb-c port to connect to pc or raspberry pi
- creality sonic pad support and easy upgrade to klipper 
- klipper support
- community support on reddit for S1 series of printers
