## Summary
When soldering your microcontroller make sure there is a tape (on all holes) sandwiched between socket and microcontroller. Read below to find out why.

## Problem 
I was scrolling through discord of split keyboards and came across a user where he shared that the microcontroller even though socketed would not come out and then it struck me I might have made the same mistake as him while soldering. That lead me to write this and share the problem with everyone who might be new to socketing a microcontroller.

Thomas Bart from splitkb has written a fabulous article on how this is done [How do I socket a microcontroller? â€“ splitkb.com](https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011263059-How-do-I-socket-a-microcontroller-) so please read that article carefully before you solder your socket and microcontroller.

If you are building a custom mechanical keyboard which uses a microcontroller and you decided to socket it then 
- first solder the sockets to the pcb and use tape to hold the socket in place.
- next ensure tape is applied to entire socket.
- next seat the controller and insert mill max pins or diode legs.
- next solder the microcontroller.
- remove the microcontroller , remove the tape.
- reinsert the microcontroller.

this tape ensures that the solder does not pass through into the socket its super important part of this whole soldering process as you socket your microcontroller.

Hope this helps someone from making the mistakes I made.
